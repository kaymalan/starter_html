            <p><i>"Sprout, a shy and elusive kitten when he first arrived at four months old, gradually became an affectionate companion. He enjoyed sleeping on my bed, but his early morning wake-up calls at 6:30 AM were a daily routine.</i></p>
            <p><i>"During my challenging academic phase, Sprout became my constant companion during late-night drawing sessions, quietly curling up on my lap, providing comfort and banishing solitude."</i><br>-Kai Liu</p>

            <p>Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black cute nose. Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest. Rocket loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed.</p>
            <p>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will ‘say hi’ to you after a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size dogs are hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, don’t hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be super happy the whole day.</p>
